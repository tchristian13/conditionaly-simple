# Conditionally Simple

### Introduction

Today you'll be branching to return different results based on the parameters passed in--first using `if` statements, and then `if` with `else`. Time to really unlock the power of booleans!


### Tools You'll Use

* Full functions, with return values and parameters and the whole shebang.
* Basic booleans.
* Comparison operators (`===`, `>`, etc.).
* `if` and `if-else`.


### Workflow

* Copy and create a new repo.
* Run `npm test` in a terminal of your choosing (I prefer a full-screen one!).
* Code away in `main.js` until all your tests are passing.


### Tasks

In this assignment, you'll create a set of functions to analyze the length of strings and retrieve specific information based on their lengths.

### Task Instructions:

1. **isItLong**: Create a function called `isItLong` that checks if the given string is longer than 20 characters. If it is, return the string "That's a long string!".

2. **isItMedium**: Write a function named `isItMedium` that checks if the given string is between 10 and 20 characters long, inclusive. If it is, return the string "That's a regular sized string!".

3. **isItShort**: Implement a function called `isItShort` that checks if the given string is shorter than 10 characters. If it is, return the string "That's a small string!". Otherwise, return "That's not a small string!".

4. **howLongIsMyString**: Create a function called `howLongIsMyString` that analyzes the length of the input string and returns specific messages based on its length:
   - If the string is longer than 20 characters, return "That's a long string!".
   - If the string is between 10 and 20 characters long, inclusive, return "That's a regular sized string!".
   - If the string is shorter than 10 characters, return "That's a small string!".

5. **personsHeight**: Write a function named `personsHeight` that retrieves the height of instructors based on their names:
   - If given the string "Shaq", return the number `85`.
   - If given the string "Zooey", return the number `65`.
   - For any other input, return the string "I don't know everyone's height!".

Ensure each function performs its designated task accurately according to the provided specifications.
